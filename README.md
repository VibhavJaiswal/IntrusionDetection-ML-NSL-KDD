# IntrusionDetection-ML-NSL-KDD

# 🚀 Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection - ML Model Analysis (NSL-KDD)

## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains an in-depth machine learning analysis for **cybersecurity intrusion detection** using the **NSL-KDD dataset**. The project evaluates **eight different machine learning models** to detect network intrusions and compares their performance based on key metrics.

## 📊 Dataset: NSL-KDD
The **NSL-KDD dataset** is an improved version of the original KDD 99 dataset, used for network intrusion detection research. It removes duplicate records and balances the dataset for better evaluation of ML models.

## 🏆 Key Features
- Preprocessing and feature engineering on NSL-KDD dataset.
- Implementation of **8 different ML models** for intrusion detection.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Insights and comparison of model performance.
